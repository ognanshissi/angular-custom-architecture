# Angular Architecture

This project is not far from Angular auto generated application, what you get with this project:
- [Angular 13](https://angular.io/)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for e2e
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for Unit Testing
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)

The good thing is you get all those packages install for your new [Angular](https://angular.io) project.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests
